Day 1 of learning C#!.

No progress today, just watched one video of .NET CORE 6 video.

Mainly was just cleaning room and updating on content.

21 March 2024:

Spent about 5 hours coding today. Was mainly debugging and it I couldn't solve the bug even after several hours spent T_T

However, I indeed learned and understood the project that I am working at better, in terms of the codebase and the flow of the code.

The code was mainly revolving around infinite loop, and needed a way to prevent loop from happening while still ensuring everything works nicely.

Gonna try to resolve the bug tomorrow!
